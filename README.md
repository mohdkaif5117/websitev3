My personal website. Live version is [here](https://mohammadkaif.com).


If you want to create your personal website here is the guide for you:

Download the github files for the personal webiste portfolio from my repository after that open the code in editor like VS Code or any online/ offline  code editor. Much knowledge of html and css is not required so any personal can edit and create his or her website using my work. 

After that you just need to edit the index, home, about, project, experience, research, and contact file from the repository and fill your information in place of mine. 

You then need to make changes of the file and associate it with your respective document for example attaching your resume, your LinkedIn profile link, etc. Make sure to make the changes in order to get the best outcome. 


After making these changes you need to upload these files to github make your own project repository and upload these files there. 

Then get a domain and host this website on a server. 

(Github pages is the easiest way to host the website)


Some domains and server host could be done from:

Google Domains
Firebase
Cloudflare
