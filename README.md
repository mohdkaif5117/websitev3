My personal website. Live version is [here](https://mohammadkaif.com).


If you want to create your personal website here is the guide for you:

Download the github files for the personal webiste portfolio from my repository after that open the code in editor like VS Code or any online/ offline editor. 

After that you just need to edit the index, home, about, project, experience, research, and contact tab and fill your information in place of mine. 

You then need to make changes of the file and links and associate it with your respective document for example attaching your resume, your LinkedIn profile link, etc. 


After making these changes you need to get a domain and host this website on a server. 

Some domains and server host could be done from:

Google Domains
Firebase
Cloudflare
