My personal website. Live version is [here](https://mohdkaif5117.github.io/websitev3/index.html).


If you want to create your personal website here is the guide for you:

Download the github files of the webiste from my repository after that open the code in editor like VS Code or any online/ offline editor. 

After that you just need to edit the index, home, about, project, experience, research, and contact tab and fill your information in place of mine. 

You then need to make changes of the file and links and associate it with your respective document for example attaching your resume, your LinkedIn profile link, etc.
